## TASK
The requirements for this task is to take the provided users.csv and repos.json file and create a list of users and the number of repos they are assigned to.

The output should be in the format:
```
<username> - <repository count> repos
```


Example output:
```
dominick.mathews - 11
savion.davenport - 9
gunner.benitez - 8
elisabeth.cooley - 1
```

If a user is in the users.csv file and they are not assigned to any repos in the repos.json file, then they should not be included in the program output.

If a user is not present in the users.csv file, then they should not be included in the program output.

The list should be sorted by number of repos the user is assigned to, descending.
